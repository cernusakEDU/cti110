# Employee Pay Calculator

# Pseudocode
# 1. Initialize counters and accumulators to track the number of employees, as well as totals for overtime, regular, and gross pay.
# 2. Begin a loop that will continue until the user inputs "Done" as the employeeâ€™s name.
# 3. Within the loop:
#    - Request the employee's name.
#    - If the name is "Done", break out of the loop.
#    - Ask for the number of hours worked and the hourly pay rate.
#    - Determine overtime hours; if hours exceed 40, calculate the difference; otherwise, set overtime hours to zero.
#    - Calculate overtime pay by multiplying overtime hours by 1.5 times the hourly rate.
#    - For regular hours, if hours worked are over 40, set regular hours to 40; otherwise, set it to the hours worked.
#    - Find regular pay by multiplying regular hours by the hourly pay rate.
#    - Compute gross pay as the sum of regular pay and overtime pay.
#    - Display the employee's details in a structured table.
#    - Increase the employee count and add values to the running totals for overtime pay, regular pay, and gross pay.
# 4. After the loop ends, display the overall totals for all employees.
